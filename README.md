# Coding Challange


## Challenge #1
Build a small server in Node.js that stores files and handles their access.

Technology stack:
Nodej.js
JS
Service requirements:
- [X] The service has an endpoint for uploading new files
- [X] The service has an endpoint to get the most recent file
- [X] (Optional) The service has an endpoint for deleting a file
- [ ] (Optional) The service has an endpoint for replacing a file
The files can be stored on the file system for simplicity reasons.


_To see it running_:
- Have node 18 installed.
- Change into `./node-server/`
- Run `npm start` or `node node-server/src/server.js`.


## Challenge #2
Build a small web application where you can play tic tac toe.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

Technology stack:
React
JS
Only in the browser, no server required

Requirements:
- [X] Two players can play tic tac toe and the web app can handle the game rules.
- [X] The game displays who won
- [X] The game offers the possibility to start a new game
No special multiplayer handling: Two players can play this game by just using the same input device (e.g. mouse)


_To see it running_:
- Open `react-ttt/index.html` in your browser (drag and drop)


## Notes

The focus lies on the code and not on the design. The webpage only needs to be functional
It would be good if the code is accessible via some git repository.

Îšeep in mind that quality is more important than just trying to solve this challenge as fast as possible. We're happy to see your result within five days. We are already very excited. You can send it us via Github (https://github.com)
